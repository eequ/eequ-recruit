## Software Engineering Challenge

Objective: This challenge assesses your ability to transform existing code into a robust, maintainable, and extensible
solution. You will refactor a provided codebase, applying software engineering best practices to prepare it for future
enhancements and evolving requirements.

### The Task:

You are presented with an initial, unrefactored codebase. Your task is to:

1. Refactor and Improve Existing Code: Identify areas for improvement within the current code. This includes, but is not
   limited to:

    1. Clarity and Readability
    2. Modularity
    3. Maintainability
    4. Efficiency (where applicable)

2. Prepare for Future Expansion: Design and implement the code with extensibility in mind. Consider how new features or
   changes in requirements could be integrated smoothly without significant rework. This might involve:

    1. Applying Design Patterns
    2. Abstracting Functionality

### Deliverables:

1. Your refactored and improved code.
2. (Optional, but highly recommended) A brief explanation (e.g., in comments or a separate README) of the key changes
   you made and the rationale behind your design decisions. Highlight how your changes address the stated objectives.

### Evaluation Criteria:

We will evaluate your solution based on:

1. Code Quality
2. Architectural Design
3. Problem-Solving
4. Understanding of Best Practices
